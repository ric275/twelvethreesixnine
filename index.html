  <p class="intro">
    Users of objects, consumers of goods.
    <br>
    I serve notice on you all.
    <br>
    It's coming.
    <br>
    Oh boy. It's coming.
    <br>
    Today you leave me no choice.
    <br>
    Today we develop our own ideas.
    <br>
    For too long have we all suffered.
    <br>
    No more.
    <br>
    The glory we once had, is gone.
    <br>
    Clutter and complexity do not constitute richness.
    <br>
    Stop pretending.
    <br>
    It's over.
    <br>
    The sooner one can accept this truth,
    <br>
    the sooner we can move on.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Together.
